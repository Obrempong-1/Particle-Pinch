# ⭐ Kinetic Particles – AI-Driven Interactive Particle Universe

Kinetic Particles is a real-time 3D particle simulation that combines **hand-tracking**, **AI-generated visual themes**, and **React Three Fiber** to create an immersive interactive experience.  
Control thousands of particles with intuitive gestures and instantly restyle the entire system using natural language.

This is a personally customized project — built and designed as your own interactive particle world.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 AI-Generated Themes
Type creative prompts such as:

- "matrix green rain"  
- "fireflies drifting in the woods"  
- "cosmic nebula explosion"  
- "floating ice crystals"

The AI converts your text into a complete particle configuration, including colors, shapes, speed, noise, and distribution.

### ✋ Hand Tracking Interaction
Powered by MediaPipe Vision:

- **Pinch** → Attract particles  
- **Open Hand** → Push particles away  
- **Swipe/Move** → Create directional trails

All camera processing happens **locally in your browser**.

### 🌌 Advanced Particle Physics
- 10,000+ instanced particles
